# Detecting Depression and Mental Illness using Machine Learning and Data Science

Hi! I worked on this project with [Dileepa Manage](https://github.com/Dlp565/Dlp565.github.io). This is our final project for our Intro to Data Science class that takes you through the entire data science pipeline. We explore the different factors of depression and create a machine learning model to help predict depression based on key environmental factors. To view our final product, open the index.html file.
